      <br>
    <p> We created an interactive haunted mansion game in which you answer quentions and earn points to make the ghosts happy and continue on or lose points to make the ghosts angry and lose. </p>

    <h2>   1.2.5 Tetris!  </h2>
      <img src="Images/tetrisimg.PNG" height = "300">
      <br>
    <p> We created our own, simplified version of tetris in which a peice is randomly generated and you can move it and drop it into the grid. The pieces will stop from colliding, and you get points based on how many shapes you can fit! </p>
    <br> <br> <br>	    
    <h2>   Scratch Project - Mouse Maze  </h2>
      <img src="Images/tetrisimg.PNG" height = "300">
      <br>
    <p> We decided to create a mouse game maze where a mouse has to try and get through different levels to get food. You can choose the color of your mouse and the trail it draws and you have a time limit to solve as many levels as possible!</p>
